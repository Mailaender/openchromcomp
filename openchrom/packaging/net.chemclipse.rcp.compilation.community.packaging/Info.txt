Maven/Tycho is used to compile the product.
After a successful build, there is a folder called "target" which contains among others the folders:

products
repository

Please navigate to products. There is a folder called:

net.openchrom.rcp.compilation.product.id

Please copy run_packaging.sh to the folder and edit the source code path. Then run the script, e.g. as a Hudson shell script:

cd openchrom/plugins/net.openchrom.rcp.compilation.product/target/products/net.openchrom.rcp.compilation.product.id/
cp ../../../../../packaging/net.openchrom.rcp.compilation.packaging/run_packaging.sh run_packaging.sh
chmod a+x run_packaging.sh
./run_packaging.sh
