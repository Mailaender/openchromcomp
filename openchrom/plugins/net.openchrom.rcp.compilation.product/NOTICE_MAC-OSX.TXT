Notice for Mac OSX users.

Prerequisites:
	The JRE or JDK 1.6 (Java 6) must be installed before running OpenChrom.
	There are some confusing issues about Java and Mac OSX, as Java 6 is available for 64-bit Intel-based Macs only.
	
	http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4140

	Multi-core Intel Macs should use the x86_64 version: 
	
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/openchrom/files/REL-0.2.0/openchrom_macosx.cocoa.x86_64_0.2.0.zip/download 

	Mac OSX Leopard (10.5) tries to run the x86 versions under the 32-bit Java 5, which causes a lot of errors.
	There alternative ways to install Java 6 (32-bit for 10.4 and 10.5 / 64-bit for 10.5) on Mac OSX:

Enable the update mechanism:
	The update mechanism needs to be activated manually under Mac OSX if you want to install new features.
	See:
